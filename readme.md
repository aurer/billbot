Billbot
=======

A simple recurring bill and debit tracking web app built using the [Laravel](http://laravel.com) framework.

Allows me to enter all my recurring bills so I can keep track of them and see how much I'm spending each month.

It also can send me an email when an important bill is coming up e.g. Cat tax, MOT, insurance etc.

## Redevloped for Laravel 4

This version replaces the [previous version](https://raw.github.com/aurer/billbot_laravel_3) which was developed on Laravel 3.
